# **App Name**: ArchiText

## Core Features:

- Requirement Input Interface: Provide a clean interface for users to input natural language system requirements and design constraints.
- AI-Powered Architecture Design: Utilize a generative AI tool to analyze user requirements and propose an initial, production-ready system architecture diagram and component selections.
- Trade-off Analysis Tool: An AI-driven tool that provides comprehensive trade-off analysis for proposed architectural choices, detailing benefits and drawbacks for different design paths.
- Azure Cost Estimation Tool: An AI tool that estimates Azure cloud costs based on the generated architecture and projected resource usage.
- Boilerplate Code Generation Tool: Generate Dockerized boilerplate code for the core services defined within the designed architecture.
- Architecture Storage & Retrieval: Enable users to save, browse, and reload their created architecture designs for future reference or modification.

## Style Guidelines:

- Color scheme: Dark mode to convey a professional, high-tech, and focused environment suitable for deep analytical work.
- Primary accent color: #7233E6 (a deep, insightful violet-blue), chosen to represent intelligence, creativity, and the innovative nature of agentic systems.
- Background color: #26202B (a very dark, desaturated violet-grey), providing a subtle hint of the primary hue while maintaining a clean, non-distracting canvas.
- Secondary accent color: #B8BBFF (a lighter, vibrant blue), used to highlight interactive elements, calls to action, and important data points for strong contrast.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for its modern, slightly technical aesthetic, perfectly aligning with the system design platform's identity.
- Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) to ensure excellent readability and a neutral, objective tone for presenting complex technical information.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying code snippets with optimal clarity and distinction.
- Emphasize a structured and organized layout with clear separation of content sections, supporting complex information display.
- Subtle and purposeful micro-animations to indicate progress during AI computations or code generation, enhancing user feedback without distraction.
